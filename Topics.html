<!--activity 1-->
<p><h5>
  DATA is defined as a set of symbols, which are used to, represents objects,
   events, activities, quantities, and other entities, which can be processed or manipulated,
    by manual or automatic means.
</p>
<br>  
  <p>
  Today, the computer is widely used in processing data.
</h5></p>
<br>
<h1> What Is Information?</h1>
<h5><br>Information is defined as knowledge gained through study,
   communication, research, or instruction. Essentially,
    information is the result of analysing and interpreting pieces of data.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Whereas data is the individual figures, numbers, or graphs
  , information is the perception of those pieces of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<br>For example, a set of data could include temperature readings in a location over several years.
 Without any additional context, those temperatures have no meaning.
</p>

<p>
However, when you analyse and organise that information, 
you could determine seasonal temperature patterns or even broader climate trends.
 Only when the data is organised and compiled in a useful way can it provide information
  that is beneficial to others.   
</p>

<br>
<p>
<h1>The Key Differences Between Data vs Information</h1>
</p>
<br>
<p>
  <h5>
Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.
While data is raw and unorganised, information is organised.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. 
Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.
Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analysed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information. 
Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics.
 Information is typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas.
Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.

            The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
             Arithmetic is performed according to an order of operations.

             An operator performs an action on one or more operands.
             <br> 
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
             The common arithmetic operators are:
             </p>

             <p>

            <br>

            <br>
            Modulus (associated with integers)
            <br>
            %
            
            </p> 
            <p>
              <br>
            These arithmetic operators are binary, that is they have two operands.
             The operands may be either constants or variables.
            </p>
            <p>
            age + 1
          </p>
          <p>
            This expression consists of one operator (addition) which has two operands.
          </p>
          <p> 
            The first is represented by a variable named age and the second is a literal constant. 
            If age had a value of 14 then the expression would evaluate (or be equal to) 15.
            <br>
            These operators work as you have learned them throughout your life with the exception
             of division and modulus. We normally think of division as resulting in an answer that
              might have a fractional part (a floating-point data type).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, division, when both
               operands are of the integer data type, may act differently.
               <br>
               Please refer to the next section
                on “Integer Division and Modulus”.
            Arithmetic Assignment Operators
            Many programming languages support a combination of the assignment (=) 
            and arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %). Various textbooks call them 
            “compound assignment operators” or “combined assignment operators”.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Their usage can be explained in terms of the assignment operator and the arithmetic operators.
             In the table, we will use the variable age and you can assume that it is of integer data type.
